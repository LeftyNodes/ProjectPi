          <br>
          <br>
          <pre style="color: white; font-size:18px">In general, a <b>node</b> refers to a basic unit or component in a larger system or structure. 
            The term <b>"node"</b> is used in many different fields, including <b>computer science</b>, mathematics, <b>physics</b>, and biology.</pre>
          <br><pre style="color: white; font-size:18px">In computer science, a <b>node</b> often refers to a fundamental element of a data structure, such as a linked list, tree, or graph. 
            In a linked list, for example, each <b>node</b> contains a piece of data and a pointer to the next node in the list. 
            In a tree or graph, each node typically represents a data element and is connected to other <b>nodes</b> by edges.</pre>
            <br><pre style="color: white; font-size:18px">In mathematics, a <b>node</b> can refer to a point at which a curve intersects itself or another curve. 
              In physics, a <b>node</b> can refer to a point of zero amplitude in a standing wave pattern.</pre>
              <br><pre style="color: white; font-size:18px"><strong>The specific meaning of the term "node" will depend on the context in which it is used.</pre></strong>
